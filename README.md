# MMD3_Helper

 A helper program for [DesktopMagicEngine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1096550/Desktop_Magic_Engine/), [DesktopMMD3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1480480/DesktopMMD3Miss_Fish/) and the new [DesktopMMD4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968650/DesktopMMD4Born_to_Dance/) . Written in [AutoIt3](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) script with the help of [awesome ISN AutoIt Studio](https://www.isnetwork.at/).

### Updated on 05/15/2022:
New v1.0.6 gives your MMD4 over 200 idle movements. You just need to decide to go with the tame "Idle Actions" or more variety "Misc Actions".

For the idle movements to work, you need to subscribe to a workshop item first. It's over 160mb big, but it's free, so no biggy, right? The link is below.

### Update on 05/12/2022:
New feature for random dancing: Right now if you enable "Random Dancing with Program" in the settings, whenever that program plays sound, all the models will start a random dance. In MDE and MMD3, the dance will change every minute, in MMD4, it will randomly choose a VMD file from the workshop contents, and it will change to a new VMD when the current VMD dance ends.

### Just switched to tray menu based programming instead of regular GUI:
Currently working with the code to show the models that are loaded:

More details will be in the Pateon page.
